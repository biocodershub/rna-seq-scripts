# These items describe different directories needed by the RNA-Seq pipeline.
# Each directory contains data or programs.
#
# rnaseq_dir: a "root" directory under which various resources can be found 
# script_dir: where most of the top-level rna-seq scripts are located
# bin_dir: the location of several standard executable files; differs between the cluster and other machines
# genomes_dir: the location of geneomic data, including bowtie indexes
# python_lib: the location of many rna-seq pipeline modules written in python

# This section contains the location of files and other information
# used by the pipeline code to create scripts that define a specfic pipeline.
# domain: the general location of templates and template fragments
# step_template: a template file describing a generic pipeline
# starflow_dir: the location of the starflow provenance library
# starflow_template: a python script template that launches a pipeline under starflow control
# rnaseq_template: a python script template describing a pipeline (launched by starflow_template, above)
# starflow_initialize: a starflow command needed by the starflow template
# starflow_command: Can be one of "FullUpdate" or "FindOutWhatWillUpdate"; will determine if the pipeline is actually  run or just examined
